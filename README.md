# EMAFY

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Getting Started

- You'll need to follow some steps, but basically the foundation of the project is [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) with [nodejs plugin](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) and to properly config your `.env` file;
- with `asdf` installed, run `asdf install`, since there is a `.tool-versions` file, `asdf` will automatically install the nodejs version the project uses;
- copy the content from `.env.example` and create a new `.env` file, with your API key and urls;  
- run `npm install`;
- run `npm start` and have fun!
